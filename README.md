`twilight-interactions` is a set of macros and utilities to work with Discord Interactions using [`twilight`](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight).

**Note:** This crate is not affiliated with the [`twilight`](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight) project.

## Features
- **Slash command parsing**: parse interaction data as typed structs using the `CommandModel` macro.
- **Slash command creation**: create commands from your structs with the `CreateCommand` macro. Commands are configured using attributes.

```rust
use twilight_interactions::command::{CommandModel, CreateCommand, ResolvedUser};

#[derive(CommandModel, CreateCommand)]
#[command(name = "hello", desc = "Say hello to other members")]
struct HelloCommand {
    /// Message to send
    message: String,
    /// User to send the message to
    user: Option<ResolvedUser>
}
```
